# Containerz - ùïê
Practical assignment for the course: Software Containerization.

The following technologies are used:
- ./client: [svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
  - UI library: [shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/)
- ./server: [golang](https://go.dev/)
  - Web Framework: [echo](https://echo.labstack.com/)
- ./database: [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/)

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/kubernetes/) `kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.13.3/cert-manager.yaml`
- Namespaces: `kubectl create namespace y-dev && kubectl create namespace y-prod`
- A persistent volume claim for the database: `kubectl apply -f yaml-files/y-db-storage.yaml`

### Install
Edit `helm-chart/values.yaml` to you liking and then simply run `helm install y-dev ./helm-chart --namespace y-dev` to (for example) install the application in the development environment.

### Scaling
Examples:
- Edit `helm-chart/values.yaml` and change the `replicas` to 3 for one of the deployments and then run `helm upgrade y-dev ./helm-chart --namespace y-dev` to horizontally scale to 3 replicas.
- `kubectl scale deployment y-api-deployment --replicas=3 -n y-dev` to horizontally scale the API deployment to 3 replicas.
- Use an autoscaler: `kubectl autoscale deployment y-api-deployment --min=1 --max=3 --cpu-percent 60 -n y-dev` to horizontally scale the API deployment up to a maximum of 3 replicas when the average CPU utilization is above 60%.

### Uninstall
Run `helm uninstall y-dev --namespace y-dev` to uninstall the application.

## Upgrading
Run `helm upgrade y-dev ./helm-chart --namespace y-dev` to upgrade the application after making changes to the chart. In the video, we show upgrading a part of the application using a rolling update and the other part using a canary release. We will update the y-client deployment to [version 1.1.0](src/y-client-1.1.0/), which includes our mascot [Gopher](src/y-client-1.1.0/src/lib/assets/go-gopher.svg) to show in the bottom-left corner of the application.

We will describe how we updated our application in the video here.

### Rolling update
As the rolling update is the default strategy for Kubernetes deployments, we can use Helm for updating the client application. We simply replace the image tag for the y-client to be 1.1.0 and run `helm upgrade y-dev ./helm-chart --namespace y-dev` to upgrade the application. The rolling update will be performed automatically. We can track the progress of the rolling update by running `kubectl rollout status deployment y-client-deployment -n y-dev`. Afterwards, we can use `kubectl describe deployment y-client-deployment -n y-dev` to see the history of the deployment and see that the rolling update was performed, one pod at a time.

### Canary release
This one, we have to do manually. We create a new [deployment yaml file](yaml-files/y-client-deployment-v2.yaml). This one uses the new image tag, but uses the **same app label**, so the service will also distribute traffic to these pods. We apply this file by running `kubectl apply -f yaml-files/y-client-deployment-v2.yaml`. After verifying that the update was successful, we can scale the new (canary) deployment to 3 replicas and delete the old deployment. Now, the whole application is updated to the new version of the client.
